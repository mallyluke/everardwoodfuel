        <h2>Hardwood logs</h2>
        <p1>We are a family farm that diversified into supplying logs and woodchips in 2010. All our
        firewood is seasoned, barn stored and Ready to Burn Woodsure certified. Burning Woodsure
        certified logs means you are using woodfuel that meet the required standards for your boiler
        or wood burning stove.
        All our firewood is sourced from 400 acres of our own sustainably managed woodlands and
        30 miles of hedgerows on the farm</p1>

        <h2>Advantages of Ready to Burn Woodsure Certified Logs</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Higher Efficiency</dt>
            <dd>Ready-to-burn logs have a lower moisture content, leading to more
                efficient burning. This means more heat output per log, making them more cost-effective in
                the long run.</dd>
            <dt>Less Smoke and Soot</dt>
            <dd>Drier wood produces less smoke and soot, reducing the need for
                chimney cleaning and lowering the risk of chimney fires.</dd>
            <dt>Easier to Ignite and Burn</dt>
            <dd>Seasoned wood ignites more easily and burns more consistently, providing a reliable heat source.</dd>
            <dt>Cost Savings</dt>
            <dd>Although ready-to-burn logs might be more expensive upfront, their higher
                efficiency and longer burn times can result in overall cost savings.</dd>
            <dt>Support Local Economy</dt>
            <dd>Purchasing wood from local suppliers can support local
                businesses and reduce transportation-related emissions.</dd>
            <dt>Improved Air Quality</dt>
            <dd>Burning seasoned wood reduces indoor air pollution compared to
                burning wet or improperly seasoned wood, leading to better respiratory health for inhabitants.</dd>
            <dt>Less Creosote Build-up</dt>
            <dd>Using dry wood minimizes the build-up of creosote in chimneys,
                reducing the risk of chimney fires and the need for frequent cleanings.</dd>
            <dt>Storage</dt>
            <dd>Seasoned wood can be stored for long periods without deteriorating, as long as it is
                kept dry, making it convenient to have a ready supply for heating needs.</dd>
